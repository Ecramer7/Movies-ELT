# Movies-ELT
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to help Britta create an automated pipeline that takes new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. This was done byt refactoring the code from the module to create one function that takes in the three files -- Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLEns rating data - and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a SQL database. This process was done in Deliverables 1-4 below.

## Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files 

## Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data

## Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data 

## Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
